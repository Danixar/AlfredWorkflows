# Alfred Workflow Backups

Where my custom Alfred Workflow data is backed up. Each folder contains a different custom Workflow.

## How to import (Dumb way)
	1. In Alfred, navigate to workflow, and create a new blank workflow
	2. Open new blank workflow in finder
	3. Open a folder in this git repo for the workflow you want 
	4. Drag the git folder's contents into the blank workflows folder
	5. Voila!

**Note: I should really just import alfred executables files instead of the above method (which is straight out of 2008)**
